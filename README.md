# HTMLquizwithTimer

This code was created using a bunch of various sources;
I wanted the timer to work from a value lower than 10 but I could not get it to work off a minute, so for whatever reason I stuck with 10.

Here are the resources I used to help me get this code - the 2 primary things I needed assistance with was the timer, and the logic of the quiz.
